## 1. Explore the socio-economic value of nature

Ignoring the value of ecosystem services may lead to unbalanced policy 
and investment decisions.

The [Nature Value Explorer](https://github.com/orgs/URBREATH/repositories) focuses on pragmatic methods
that value these ecosystem services and helps planners,
land managers and policy makers to map nature's socio-economic importance.

The Nature Value Explorer is a [VITO](https://vito.be/en) online tool, that is freely available to use from your web-browser.

In the [Urbreath project](https://urbreath.eu/), we are exploring integrating the tool into the Urbreat Digital Twin solution,
so that multiple cities across Europe can benefit from it.
